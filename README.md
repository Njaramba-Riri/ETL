# ETL
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load, which is a process used to integrate data from different sources into a single data warehouse or database. The ETL process involves the following steps:

- _Extract:_ In this step, data is extracted from multiple sources, which can include databases, spreadsheets, flat files, or web services.

- _Transform:_ The data extracted from different sources may be in different formats and may contain inconsistencies, errors, or duplicate records. In this step, the data is transformed into a consistent and usable format that can be stored in a single database. This may involve data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, or merging.

- _Load:_ Once the data is transformed, it is loaded into a data warehouse or database. The data can be loaded in batches or in real-time, depending on the needs of the organization.

ETL is commonly used in business intelligence and data analytics to create a centralized data repository that can be used for reporting, analysis, and decision-making. ETL tools such as Talend, Informatica, and DataStage automate the ETL process and make it easier for organizations to manage large volumes of data from different sources.
